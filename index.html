                          <h3> <b> Lithos Mostly Faithful Mod </b> 
                    <h4> Many resource packs focus on totally changing the look of Minecraft by completely replacing common textures with things never before seen in the game. There's nothing wrong with this, but sometimes you just want something that still looks like the game you're used to playing, only better. There are a number of resource packs which handle this particular demand, and the Lithos pack is one of them. With a 32x resolution, it provides textures which are overall just a bit better than what you're used to seeing in vanilla Minecraft. This can be seen in everything, from dirt to buttons to crops. Speaking of crops, the Lithos resource pack does an excellent job of differentiating the images for crops. That is to say, when you plant a potato, tomato or wheat, you'll know what it is you just planted even before it grows to maturity. Also, it will be clear when food is actually fully grown and ready to be harvested, so you won't ever pick something just before it is done growing again. That’s a really annoying part of Minecraft, especially when growing wheat, and Lithos totally takes care of the issue. Even netherwort is bright, bold and easy to see in its various stages of growth. </h4>

                          <h3> <b> Star Wars Droids Mod </b> 
                    <h4> If you’re a fan of Star Wars you’ll know the importance of droids. With this mod you can finally have them at your disposal. These are indeed the droids you’re looking for. The R2 units and 3P0 Protocol Droids are true staples in the Star Wars Universe. By right-clicking them you can bring up a GUI to show the actions they can perform. 3P0 can be used for teleporting and can even help build houses. R2 acts as a roving chest following close behind and Viper probes are more well know amongst the Empire but you can craft your own here and use them as personal transports around your world. If you need to repair your droids just craft a wrench and you can use that bring them back to full health.</h4>

                     <h3> <b> Wallpaper Mod </b> 
                    <h4> The Wallpaper mod aims to dress up your walls with neat designs that don’t take up any extra space. These simply paste over existing walls without needing to move things around or add any additional bulk to your rooms. The patterns go up four block spaces and repeat for as long as you need. But be sure to place the wallpaper in succession or you may get mismatched tiles. There are many different designs to suit whatever room you want to put it in. Whether it’s a kid’s room or a mural or even an ancient tomb, you have options to improve your interior design. You can place wallpaper behind items and blocks without destroying them. Just place it as you normally would and the wallpaper sticks right behind it and if you want to remove any wallpaper 
                    just craft a scraper and right click any pieces you want gone.</h4>
